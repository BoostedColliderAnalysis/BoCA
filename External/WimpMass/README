********************************************************************************* 
This package contains two C++ subroutines useful for event 
reconstruction in events with missing particles. The references
are arXiv: 0707.0030 and arXiv: 0802.4290. 

The two functions are given in "topology22.cpp" and "topology33.cpp"
in the "src/" directory. See the header of the source file for usage. 
"ROOT" (http://root.cern.ch/drupal/) is required for compiling 
topology33.cpp. The directory "examples/" contains a couple of examples 
calling these subroutines. You need to modify the Makefile in the "src" 
directory and "examples" directory to point to the correct ROOT location.
