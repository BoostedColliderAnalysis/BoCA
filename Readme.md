# Readme

This code performs staged BDT analyses using root files as in- and output format.

## Dependencies

* `ROOT` version >= 6 and compiled with TMVA and MathMore
* `fastjet`
* `fastjet contrib` (must be compiled with `CXXFLAGS=-fPIC`)
* `Boost` (`Optional`, `Range`, `Units`)

The BoCA code makes heavy use of modern c++ features. The limiting factor for the minimal supportet compiler version is given by the use of return type deduction.
Therefore the compiler version must be
* GCC version >= 4.9
* Clang version >= 3.3

## Installation

* the following is tested on recent ubuntu installations

~~~~
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
~~~~

* for quicker compilation (install ccache and ninja-build)

~~~~
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G Ninja ..
ninja
~~~~

## Usage

Each analysis needs a dedicated `Analysis` class, a set of `Tagger` classess and a `main.cpp` file.
The `Analysis` class contains the global information of the analysis, such as file names, path names, variables names etc.
Every `Tagger` class tags or reconstructs one specific particle or signature. Each analysis needs at least one dedicated `Tagger`.
The `main.cpp` defines the order in which each `Tagger` is passed to the `Analysis`.

## Standard model

The acceptances for Standard model particles at a future 100 TeV collider are presented [here](doc/standard-model.md).
These plots represent some examples of the power of this code.

## Coding style

* use standard library when possible
* avoid heap allocation `new`
* prefer references `&` over pointers `*`
* Classes and functions are written in CamelCase
* variables are written small_with_underscore
* member_variables_ and TemplateParamter_ end on an underscore
